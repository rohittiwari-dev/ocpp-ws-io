## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Instead, please report it privately:

1. Email **rohit@rohittiwari.me** with a description of the vulnerability.
2. Include the steps to reproduce the issue.
3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
4. Once fixed, we will publish a security advisory and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep `ocpp-ws-io` secure!
