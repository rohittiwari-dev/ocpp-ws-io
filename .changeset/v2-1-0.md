### ✨ Features

- **OCPPRouter Engine**: Introduced an Express-style `OCPPRouter` API to support modular connection routing based on URL patterns (`server.route()`, `server.use()`, `server.auth()`).
- **Browser Middleware Parity**: Brought the internal `MiddlewareStack` outwards to the `BrowserOCPPClient`, giving `client.use()` full interceptor-like support natively in the browser.
- **TypeScript Middleware Helpers**: Shipped typed utility functions `defineRpcMiddleware` for strict browser/node interceptors, `defineMiddleware` for node connections, and `defineAuth` / `combineAuth` for highly composable authentication logic.
- **Structured Logging Configs**: Redesigned `LoggingConfig` interface using a clear `{ prettify, exchangeLog, level }` structure, standardizing real-time stream observability with `[IN]`, `[OUT]`, and `[RES]` log formatting.

### 🩹 Fixes & Additions

- **Handshake API Normalization**: Standardized legacy `endpoint` configurations by officially transitioning them to Node-native `pathname` properties inside `HandshakeInfo` and constructor objects.
- **Duplicate Handler Collisions**: Protected `client.handle()` RPC registration tables from silently overriding each other by throwing explicit runtime errors when identical handlers are accidentally attached.
- **Global Server Fallbacks**: Modernized the core `OCPPServer` HTTP routing logic to cleanly enforce wildcard sub-routers, providing built-in unauthenticated catch-alls that terminate hanging connections.
- **Logging Formatter Duplication**: Resolved manual format injection overhead inside the browser bundles by deferring payload formatting accurately to `createLoggingMiddleware()`.
