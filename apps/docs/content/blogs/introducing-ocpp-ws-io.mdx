We are excited to introduce **ocpp-ws-io**, a new comprehensive library designed to simplify the development of EV charging infrastructure. Whether you are building a Central System (CSMS) or a Charging Station simulator, `ocpp-ws-io` provides the tools you need to do it with confidence and type safety.

## Why ocpp-ws-io?

Building OCPP applications can be challenging due to the complexity of the protocol and the need for robust WebSocket handling. `ocpp-ws-io` addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types for all OCPP messages.
- **Protocol Support**: Seamless handling of OCPP 1.6, 2.0.1, and upcoming 2.1.
- **Security**: Built-in support for all security profiles (0-3), including TLS and mutual authentication.
- **Validation**: strict mode to validate messages against official JSON schemas.

## Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as installing the package:

```bash
npm install ocpp-ws-io
```

Create a simple client:

```typescript
import { OCPPClient, SecurityProfile } from "ocpp-ws-io";

const client = new OCPPClient({
  endpoint: "ws://localhost:3000",
  identity: "CP001",
  protocols: ["ocpp1.6"],
  securityProfile: SecurityProfile.NONE,
});

await client.connect();
```
