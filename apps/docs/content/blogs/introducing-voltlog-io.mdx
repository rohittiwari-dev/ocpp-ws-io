We are excited to announce **[voltlog-io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/voltlog-io)**, a robust, type-safe structured logger designed for high-throughput systems, WebSocket servers, and specifically the EV charging ecosystem.

What started as an internal module in `ocpp-ws-io` has grown into a standalone package that solves the unique logging challenges of real-time infrastructure.

## The Problem with Generic Loggers

When building Charging Station Management Systems (CSMS) handling thousands of connected chargers, generic loggers (like Winston or Pino) often fall short in three key areas:

1.  **Security Risks**: Accidentally logging `idTag`, `password`, or `authorizationKey` is a major security incident. Generic loggers need manual configuration for every sensitive field.
2.  **Noise vs. Signal**: During a mass reconnection event (e.g., power outage recovery), thousands of `BootNotification` logs can flood your storage, costing thousands of dollars while hiding the one critical `Error` you need to see.
3.  **Context Loss**: In an async WebSocket world, tracking a specific session or request across multiple microservices is painful without first-class context binding.

## Enter Voltlog-io

Voltlog is built to address these specific pain points with a pipeline architecture: **Logger → Middleware → Transports**.

### 1. Security by Design (Redaction)

Voltlog comes with built-in, deep-redaction middleware. It doesn't just check top-level keys; it traverses nested objects and arrays to scrub PII.

```typescript
import { createLogger, redactionMiddleware } from "voltlog-io";

const logger = createLogger({
  middleware: [
    redactionMiddleware({
      paths: ["password", "token", "headers.authorization", "user.secrets"],
      censor: "[REDACTED]",
    }),
  ],
});

logger.info("User login", {
  user: {
    name: "Alice",
    secrets: { token: "12345" }, // Scubbed automatically
  },
});
```

### 2. Intelligent Cost Control (Sampling)

Instead of logging _everything_, Voltlog allows probabilistic sampling. You can choose to log only 1% of `DEBUG` messages (like heartbeats) while keeping 100% of `ERROR` and `WARN` logs.

```typescript
import { samplingMiddleware } from "voltlog-io";

middleware: [
  samplingMiddleware({
    rate: 0.01, // Keep only 1% of logs...
    level: "DEBUG", // ...but only if they are DEBUG level.
  }),
];
```

This simple change can reduce your log ingestion costs by 90% without losing visibility into critical failures.

### 3. Real-Time Observability

Voltlog isn't just about disk files. It includes a **Redis Transport** for pub/sub logging, allowing you to stream logs to a real-time dashboard or a separate monitoring service.

```typescript
import { redisTransport } from "voltlog-io";
import Redis from "ioredis";

const redis = new Redis();

const logger = createLogger({
  transports: [
    redisTransport({
      client: redis,
      channel: "live-logs",
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Developer Experience First

We believe local development should be beautiful. That's why we included a zero-config `prettyTransport` that formats logs with icons, colors, and human-readable timestamps.

```typescript
// Local Dev
const logger = createLogger({
  transports: [prettyTransport({ colorize: true })], // 🌈 Beautiful output
});

// Production
const logger = createLogger({
  transports: [consoleTransport()], // 🚀 Fast, machine-readable JSON
});
```

## Integration with ocpp-ws-io

If you're using `ocpp-ws-io`, Voltlog is already powering your logs. You can enable the full experience with a simple config:

```typescript
const client = new OCPPClient({
  identity: "CP-001",
  endpoint: "wss://csms.io",
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
    prettify: true, // Enable dev-friendly output
    exchangeLog: true, // Log all OCPP protocol messages
  },
});
```

The `exchangeLog` feature uses Voltlog to capture every `CALL`, `CALLRESULT`, and `CALLERROR` with precise directionality (`IN` vs `OUT`) and latency tracking.

## Getting Started

Voltlog is open source and available on npm.

```bash
npm install voltlog-io
```

Check out the **[Documentation](/docs/voltlog-io)** for deep dives into batching, webhooks, and custom middleware.

We can't wait to see what you build with it! 🚀
