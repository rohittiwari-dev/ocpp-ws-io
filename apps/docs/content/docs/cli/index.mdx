# The ocpp-ws-io CLI

The **ocpp-ws-io** ecosystem comes with a massively powerful suite of 15 Command Line Tools. Rather than forcing you to build your own testing simulators, payload inspectors, and certificate authorities, everything is provided out of the box.

<Callout type="info">
  **Installation**  
  You can install the CLI globally via `npm install -g ocpp-ws-cli`, or run it on the fly using `npx ocpp-ws-cli <command>`.
</Callout>

## 🏗️ 1. Building & Scaffolding

These commands help you write code faster by automating boilerplate and TypeScript configuration.

### `ocpp init`

**What it does:** Bootstraps a brand new, production-ready Central System (CSMS) project in seconds.  
**When to use it:** When you are starting a new OCPP project and don't want to manually configure TypeScript, Biome, and WebSockets.

```bash
npx ocpp-ws-cli init ./my-charging-network
```

### `ocpp generate`

**What it does:** Reads your custom `.json` OCPP schemas and generates perfectly typed `.d.ts` declaration files.  
**When to use it:** When your hardware vendor provides custom DataTransfer methods and you want full IDE autocomplete in your handlers.

```bash
ocpp generate --schemas ./schemas --out ./src/generated
```

### `ocpp sdk`

**What it does:** Automatically generates a frontend-ready TypeScript SDK built around your JSON schemas.  
**When to use it:** When your Frontend UI or Mobile App teams need a type-safe API to talk to your CSMS (e.g., `api.bootNotification({...})`).

```bash
ocpp sdk --schemas ./schemas --out ./frontend/api.ts
```

## 🏎️ 2. Testing & Simulation

Testing Websockets is notoriously difficult. These tools allow you to simulate hardware and stress-test your server.

### `ocpp simulate`

**What it does:** Spins up an interactive, terminal-based Charge Point simulator.  
**When to use it:** When you need a virtual charger to connect to your CSMS so you can rapidly test your `BootNotification` and `Heartbeat` database logic.

```bash
ocpp simulate --identity CP-001 --endpoint ws://localhost:3000
```

### `ocpp virtual-station`

**What it does:** Runs a fully autonomous, state-machine governed Virtual Charge Point simulator.  
**When to use it:** When you need a "Full" OCPP simulated client to sit in the background and correctly respond to incoming `RemoteStartTransaction`, `UpdateFirmware`, and `GetDiagnostics` commands without user intervention.

```bash
ocpp virtual-station --identity VS-001 --protocol ocpp1.6
```

### `ocpp call`

**What it does:** Connects to your server, fires a single exact JSON payload, logs the response, and disconnects.  
**When to use it:** When you want to trigger a very specific scenario (like a malformed schema validation rejection) without running a full simulator.

```bash
ocpp call BootNotification '{"chargePointModel": "ModelX"}'
```

### `ocpp load-test`

**What it does:** Spawns thousands of concurrent headless web sockets.  
**When to use it:** When you've configured Redis Clustering and Rate Limiting, and want to prove your infrastructure can handle massive traffic spikes.

```bash
ocpp load-test --clients 5000 --ramp-up 30s --endpoint wss://api.csms.com
```

### `ocpp fuzz`

**What it does:** Aggressively spams your server with malformed strings, invalid arrays, and schema-breaking payloads.  
**When to use it:** To guarantee your CSMS Strict-Mode validators and crash-guards are correctly dropping bad actors before they crash Node.js.

```bash
ocpp fuzz --endpoint ws://localhost:3000 --workers 20
```

### `ocpp replay`

**What it does:** Reads an incident log file containing network frames and replays them back to your CSMS with exact timing.  
**When to use it:** When an obscure bug happens in production, and you need to reproduce the exact transaction sequence locally to find the flaw.

```bash
ocpp replay ./incidents/crash.json --target ws://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🔎 3. Observability & Debugging

When payloads are flying across the cluster, these tools give you total visibility.

### `ocpp tail`

**What it does:** Hooks into your Redis deployment to act as a real-time network sniffer across your entire fleet.  
**When to use it:** When you need to watch payloads flying in and out of a specific physical charger, but don't want to comb through massive log aggregators.

```bash
# Watch only Heartbeats from CP-999
ocpp tail --identity CP-999 --method Heartbeat --redis redis://localhost:6379
```

### `ocpp top`

**What it does:** A live terminal dashboard (TUI) showing memory, active sessions, and socket connections.  
**When to use it:** To monitor the real-time health and load distribution of your CSMS nodes.

```bash
ocpp top --redis redis://localhost:6379
```

### `ocpp proxy`

**What it does:** A Man-in-the-Middle reverse proxy that sits between a physical charger and your CSMS.  
**When to use it:** When working with 3rd-party vendors and you need to decrypt/see the encrypted raw WebSocket frames they are sending you before they hit the real server.

```bash
ocpp proxy --listen 8080 --target wss://vendor.csms.com
```

### `ocpp parse`

**What it does:** Takes messy, raw OCPP JSON array-tuples and cleanly formats them.  
**When to use it:** When you copy a raw `[2, "msg_id", "Heartbeat", {}]` string out of AWS CloudWatch and need to read it easily.

```bash
ocpp parse '[2, "123", "Heartbeat", {"vendor": "unknown"}]'
```

## 🔒 4. Enterprise Tools

Utilities for handling complex hardware requirements like Firmware and Mutual TLS.

### `ocpp certs`

**What it does:** Operates as a local Certificate Authority utilizing OpenSSL to generate `.pem` files.  
**When to use it:** When you are implementing Security Profile 2 (TLS) or Profile 3 (mTLS) and need immediate spoofed client/server certificates to validate your handshake logic.

```bash
ocpp certs --type client --identity CP-001 --out ./certs
```

### `ocpp ota`

**What it does:** A specialized HTTP static file server that supports chunked binary transfers.  
**When to use it:** When sending an `UpdateFirmware` packet to a physical EV charger, you can point the charger download URL back to this local CLI server.

```bash
ocpp ota ./firmware-binaries --port 4000
```

### `ocpp mock`

**What it does:** An HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream that endlessly spits out dummy OCPP data.  
**When to use it:** When your Frontend/React developers are building the fleet dashboard and need a fast stream of mock `MeterValues` without running a real server.

```bash
ocpp mock --port 8080 --rate 500
```
