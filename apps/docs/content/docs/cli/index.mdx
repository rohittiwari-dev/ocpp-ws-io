# The ocpp-ws-io CLI

The **ocpp-ws-io** ecosystem includes CLI tools for building, testing, and debugging OCPP infrastructure. Some are stable and shipping today, others are in beta or on the roadmap.

<Callout type="info">
  **Installation**  
  You can install the CLI globally via `npm install -g ocpp-ws-cli`, or run it on the fly using `npx ocpp-ws-cli <command>`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Command Status**: Not all CLI commands are at the same maturity level.
  Commands marked **[stable]** are fully implemented and tested. Commands marked
  **[beta]** work but may change. Commands marked **[planned]** are documented
  for roadmap visibility but not yet available.
</Callout>

## 🏗️ 1. Building & Scaffolding

These commands help you write code faster by automating boilerplate and TypeScript configuration.

### `ocpp generate` [stable]

**What it does:** Reads your custom `.json` OCPP schemas and generates perfectly typed `.d.ts` declaration files.  
**When to use it:** When your hardware vendor provides custom DataTransfer methods and you want full IDE autocomplete in your handlers.

```bash
ocpp generate --schema ./schemas/custom-cp.json --name custom-1.6
```

---

## 🏎️ 2. Testing & Simulation

Testing Websockets is notoriously difficult. These tools allow you to simulate hardware and stress-test your server.

### `ocpp simulate` [stable]

**What it does:** Spins up an interactive, automated Charge Point simulator.  
**When to use it:** When you need a virtual charger to connect to your CSMS so you can rapidly test your `BootNotification` and `Heartbeat` database logic.

```bash
ocpp simulate --identity CP-001 --endpoint ws://localhost:3000/ocpp
```

### `ocpp load-test` [stable]

**What it does:** A distributed load testing engine capable of simulating thousands of concurrent Charge Point connections.  
**When to use it:** When you've configured Redis Clustering and Rate Limiting, and want to prove your infrastructure can handle massive traffic spikes.

```bash
ocpp load-test --clients 1000 --ramp-up 20 --endpoint wss://api.csms.com/ocpp
```

### `ocpp bench` [stable]

**What it does:** Benchmarks your OCPP server's throughput (msg/s) and round-trip latency with p50/p95/p99 percentile tracking.
**When to use it:** When you want precise performance metrics to compare deployments, validate optimizations, or establish baseline latency numbers.

```bash
ocpp bench --endpoint ws://localhost:3000/ocpp --duration 30 --concurrency 5
```

### `ocpp fuzz` [stable]

**What it does:** A protocol fuzzer that aggressively spams your server with malformed strings, invalid arrays, and schema-breaking anomalies.  
**When to use it:** To guarantee your CSMS Strict-Mode validators and crash-guards are correctly dropping bad actors before they crash Node.js.

```bash
ocpp fuzz --endpoint ws://localhost:3000/ocpp --workers 20 --flood
```

---

## 🔎 3. Compliance & Auditing

When you need to ensure your implementation strictly adheres to the OCPP specification and security profiles.

### `ocpp test` [stable]

**What it does:** Runs OCTT (Open Charge Point Testing Tool) style compliance tests against a running OCPP server.  
**When to use it:** When you're ready for certification or need to verify your transport and RPC layers strictly follow OCPP specification.

```bash
ocpp test --endpoint ws://localhost:3000/ocpp --suite rpc --report md
```

### `ocpp audit` [stable]

**What it does:** An interactive wizard for production security auditing.  
**When to use it:** Before deploying to production, to ensure your endpoints are properly secured and reject unauthenticated or legacy protocol connections.

```bash
ocpp audit --endpoint wss://api.csms.com/ocpp
```

---

## 🔒 4. Security & Development Tools

Utilities for handling complex hardware requirements like Mutual TLS and mocking dashboards.

### `ocpp certs` [stable]

**What it does:** Operates as a local Certificate Authority utilizing OpenSSL to generate `.pem` files.  
**When to use it:** When you are implementing Security Profile 2 (TLS) or Profile 3 (mTLS) and need immediate spoofed client/server certificates to validate your handshake logic.

```bash
ocpp certs --type client --identity CP-001 --out ./certs
```

### `ocpp mock` [stable]

**What it does:** An HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream that endlessly spits out dummy OCPP telemetry data.  
**When to use it:** When your Frontend/React developers are building the fleet dashboard and need a fast stream of mock `MeterValues` without running a real server.

```bash
ocpp mock --port 8080 --rate 500
```

You can access the command list and flags at any time directly in your terminal:

```bash
ocpp -h
