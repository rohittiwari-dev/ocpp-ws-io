title: Introduction
description: A modern, lightweight, and type-safe structured logger for real-time infrastructure.
---

**Voltlog-io** is a structured logger designed for high-throughput systems like IoT platforms, WebSocket servers, and microservices. It is the default logging engine for `ocpp-ws-io` but works as a standalone logger in any TypeScript/JavaScript project.

If you are using `ocpp-ws-io`, you can import it directly from the package:

```ts
import { createLogger } from "ocpp-ws-io/logger";
```

No need to install `voltlog-io` separately.

It resolves common pain points in event-driven architectures: context tracking, sensitive data redaction, high-volume sampling, and developer experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Zero-Dependency Core**: Lightweight and fast. Only uses `cuid2` for ID generation.
- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Built-in redaction middleware for passwords, tokens, and headers.
- **📊 High-Throughput Ready**: Intelligent sampling to log 1% of debug logs while keeping 100% of errors.
- **⚡ Developer Experience**: Beautiful, icon-rich pretty printing for local development.
- **🔌 Universal Compatibility**: Works in Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Browsers.
- **🤖 AI Powered**: Built-in middleware to enrich error logs with AI analysis.
- **🧩 Pluggable Architecture**: 10+ Middlewares and 12+ Transports included out of the box.

## 📦 Architecture

Voltlog uses a pipeline architecture:

1.  **Logger**: The entry point (`logger.info(...)`). Generates the log entry.
2.  **Context**: Attaches bound context (e.g., `sessionId`) and dynamic context (e.g., `performance.now()`).
3.  **Middleware**: A chain of functions that process, filter, or enrich the log entry.
4.  **Transports**: The final destinations (Console, File, Redis, Datadog...) where the log is sent.
